# Tic Tac Toe
Welcome to our OOP Tic Tac Toe game. Designed and created so users are able to play the fun and classic game even with nobody else to play with. The opponent you play against in this game will make intelligent moves, so don't expect an easy win.

# About Us 
Mykyta and Ezra are Interactive Media Design students at Fanshawe College.

# How to use
Simply click on whichever box you would like to place your "X", and wait for the opponent to make their move. Once the game is complete, press the "Start New Game" button and continue playing.
